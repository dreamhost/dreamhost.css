## Framework CSS Guidelines

We follow aggressive guidelines for adding new code into the framework.

* No unsetting css
* !important in _utilities.scss only
* No numbers (0) or colours (#fff, #000) outside of _variables.scss
* Push things down with margin-bottom
* CSS is for repeatable elements and sass functionality
* Components should be truly repeatable
* Mobile first: (min-width), not (max-width)

Certain exceptions may apply to all rules of course but please check with the entire team before adding any and document heavily.

## Jira
We currently use JIRA for tickets. Please reference any relevant tickets in your pull request.
