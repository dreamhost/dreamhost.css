/*

Transition Components

  These styles define the types of transitions that we use, and default
  values for each of their properties. Use utility classes from
  scss/utilities/_transitions.scss to override specific transition
  properties.

  Usage:
  <div class="tr-scale-up-hover">
    This div scales up on hover
  </div>

*/

/*
Scale on hover
  Althought these have scaling animations, they also use a transition to the
  hover state. Therefore, the easing and duration are controlled as
  transitions.
*/
.tr-scale-up-hover {
  @include transition-duration($tr-duration);

  &:hover {
    @include scale($a-scale-up);
  }
}

.tr-scale-down-hover {
  @include transition-duration($tr-duration);

  &:hover {
    @include scale($a-scale-down);
