Animation Utilities

  These are pre-defined speeds and easings that can be used to override
  the default values for each property of an animation. Use them together
  with animation components from scss/components/_animations.scss.

  Usage:
  <div class="a-bounce a-duration-xl a-easing-cb-scale-out">
    This div bounces slowly with a cubic bezier scaling effect. The
    initial bounce is defined in the components doc, while the utility
    classes override the component's default values.
  </div>

/*
Timing
Timings are t-shirt sized. (s)mall is the shortest duration, and (xxl)tra
Large is the longest. Try to stick to these pre-defined timings. They help
us maintain consistency, usability, and accessibility. For immediate
(zero second) animations, you can use .a-duration-0.
