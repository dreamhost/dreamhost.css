	<p class="t-right"><strong>Framework Guidelines</strong></p>
	<h1 class="t-center">The Idea</h1>

	<section class="box m-bottom-large">
		<p class="t-size-large">Our interfaces are just a collection of the same things on top of a shared visual style.</p>
			<div class="c-lighter-grey p-small">Light grey</div>
			<div class="c-black t-white p-small">Black</div>
			<div class="c-blue t-white p-small">Blue</div>
			<div class="c-yellow p-small m-bottom">Yellow</div>
		<h4 class="u-inline t-bold m-right">Ubuntu for headings</h4>
		<p class="u-inline-block">Proxima Nova for body text.</p>
		<p class="box border"><em>Generous spacing</em></p>
		<p>This style will be set in a framework. Each app will only have to worry about loading the framework and then using its features to lay their pages out however they want quickly DreamHost style.</p>
		<p>This will be accomplished using a combination of pre-packaged components and hyper-specific utility classes and is partially inspired by concepts like <a href="https://solid.buzzfeed.com">Solid</a>, <a href="http://basscss.com/">BaseCSS</a>, and <a href="https://suitcss.github.io/">SuitCSS</a>, though scaled back and simplified for our specific use cases.</p>
	</section>

	<h1 class="t-center">The plan</h1>

	<section class="box m-bottom">
		<h2>Set visual defaults</h2>
		<p class="t-size-large">The visual style is handled on a global level, so UX designers and front-end developers don't need to continuously reconsider implementation details and can instead focusing on creating consistent pages quickly.</p>
		<p>Typography will have margins set according to a scale and used with HTML5 sectioning. For interface elements, margins will be applied manually to reduce unsetting of spacing styles.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="box m-bottom">
		<h2>Keep everything consistent</h2>
		<p class="t-size-large">An interface should be as simple and predictable as possible. This will be ensured by mapping all classes, components and mixins to the same variables.</p>
		<p>Ensure no numbers, colours or fonts are outside of _variables.scss. Page-specific .scss files are for mixins and responsive page layouts.</p>
	</section>

	<section class="box m-bottom">
		<h2>Use a sass grid</h2>
		<p class="t-size-large">Using <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io">Bourbon's Neat</a> allows us to scaffold our application using a minimal amount of meaningful names and then attach a responsive grid to it in your css file.</p>

	</section>

	<section class="box m-bottom">
		<h2>Use components</h2>
		<p class="t-size-large">Most of DreamHost's interfaces can be broken down into the same components being used over and over again in different ways. (tables, boxes, forms, navs, buttons, etc.)</p>
		<p>When something is being used in multiple places in different contexts, it can be proposed to be turned into a component. Components can be identified by their <a href="http://getbem.com/introduction/">BEM-style</a> notation (except tables and lists).</p>
		<p>Because all components and utility classes limit nesting and reference the same variables, it's trivial to add a component and then convert the individual implimentations over after.</p>

	</section>

	<section class="box m-bottom">
		<h2>Use utility classes for page specifics</h2>
		<p class="t-size-large">Use utility classes if a part of your application needs to adjust a font size, margin, padding or colour.</p>
		<p>This eliminates ambiguous classes and non-repeatable elements. Troubleshooting will be improved with everything having one single point of truth.</p>

	</section>

	<h1 class="t-center">Rules</h1>
	<section class="box m-bottom">
		<p class="t-size-large">When writing new code, there are certain rules that must be followed to esure we don't add technical debt and code bloat to this system.</p>
		<ul class="list list--bullets">
			<li>No unsetting css</li>
			<li>!important in _utilities.scss (and maybe /vendor) only</li>
			<li>No numbers (0) or colours (#fff, #000) outside of _variables.scss</li>
			<li>Push things down with margin-bottom</li>
			<li>CSS is for repeatable elements and layouts</li>
			<li>Mobile first: (min-width), not (max-width)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Certain exceptions may apply to all rules of course but please check with the entire team before adding any and document heavily.</p>
