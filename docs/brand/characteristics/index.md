<h3>TONE</h3>

<strong>Approachable.</strong> We’re here to help.  We take complicated technical concepts and distill them down into plain english, without judgment or condescension.  We speak to our customer’s experience level because we value them.

<strong>Conversational.</strong> We aren’t overly-formal, contrived or corporate. We’re people first, marketers second. We never sound scripted or phony. 

<strong>Fun & irreverent.</strong> We are playful and don’t mind a little humor. We try to keep it PG-13, but no promises. 

<strong>Authentic.</strong> We get straight to the point. We’re candid, don’t dance around touchy subjects, and are always real with people.

<h3>STYLE</h3>

<strong>People-Centric.</strong> There are real people working at DreamHost.  There’s real people using DreamHost.  We’ll never lose sight of that.

<strong>Playful.</strong> We’re fun! We feel positive, upbeat, and alive. 

<strong>Relevant.</strong> We aren’t dated. We use modern best practices and aesthetics. 

<strong>Simple.</strong> We’re clean, not cluttered. Function over form. A goal is always clear and effortless to achieve.
