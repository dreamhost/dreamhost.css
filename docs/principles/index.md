<h3>User needs supercede</h3>
<p class="m-bottom-7">Make no assumptions. Only through research and analysis can we truly understand our users. Talk to them. We need to appreciate their needs in order to effectively design for our users.</p>

<h3>Design with purpose</h3>
<p class="m-bottom-7">Every design element, from the largest to the smallest, must have a purpose, and contribute to the purpose of a larger element that it is a part of. If you can’t explain what an element is for, most likely it shouldn’t be there. Use motion to provide meaning, rather than just for aesthetic value. Why does a thing move the way that it does?</p>

<h3>Effortless Usability</h3>
<p class="m-bottom-7">Users should be presented with a singular visual priority on any given screen. What do you want the user to do first? They should be able to effortlessly move throughout the app. Remove all obstacles for the user. Interactions should be intuitive and obvious.</p>

<h3>Effortless Style</h3>
<p class="m-bottom-7">Designs should have a relaxed, uncomplicated aesthetic. Although deeply considered, things like color choices and typography should feel seamless and simple to users.</p>

<h3>Build to last</h3>
<p class="m-bottom-7">Designs should be unbreakable by the user. Like a children’s toy, make sure it’s designed for exploration and impossible to misuse. Make sure designs can scale as applications grow and evolve over time.</p>

<h3>Show some personality</h3>
<p class="m-bottom-7">The design should always be approachable. Usability is key, but without some personality injected here it’s going to feel unloved. Illustrations, iconography, motion, and language can all be used to add personality. Applications need to delight users.</p>
