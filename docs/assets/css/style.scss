# Only the main Sass file needs front matter (the dashes are enough)
---

// TO-DO:
// The framework should be loaded in an automatic way, ideally through
// package.json and node modules. Github Pages doesn't seem to work with
// node_modules, so we need to find a workaround. Pronbably involving
// symlinks. Until then, we'll have to manually add it like below.
@import "dreamhost-css-0.0.18/src/scss/style";

@import "hljs";

// TODO: why is this so harsh in the framework right now?
.border {border: 1px solid $light-grey !important;}

// should this be in the framework?
img {
	max-width: 100%;
	height: auto;
}
