## Updating dreamhost-css

dreamhost-css is included as an npm package that is checked in, so we can use it places that don't use npm as part of its build process. I'm looking at you, GitHub Pages.

To update, run `npm install dreamhost-css@latest --save`. That will install the newest version of the framework and update the package.json file.
